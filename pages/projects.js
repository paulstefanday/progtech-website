      <p>
        You’re working in or around tech - this covers both technical and non-technical
  roles (eg maybe you’re not a developer, but you’re working with digital platforms and
  technologies).</p>
<p>You can commit to 6 mentorship meetings over an 12 week period (via video calls),
  and you have an idea for a key project you'd like to work on or develop that will support
your work as a progressive campaigner.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <Heading variant="highlight.green">Who mentors are</Heading>
      <p>
        Our mentors are seasoned techies keen to build skills in our movement, particularly in people
who've had less access to tech skills because of gender, race, class and other factors. If you’re
interested but you've never mentored someone before, please apply! Mentors are provided with
support to step up.
      </p> */}
