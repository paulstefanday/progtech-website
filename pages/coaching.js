    <p>We're coordinating a monthly <em>Tech Help Please!</em> peer-to-peer coaching day on the second Tuesday of every month. The next one is from 10am-4pm on Tuesday 10th August.</p>
    <p>Sign up now to get help from digital and tech coaches. If you have a tech or digital problem or project you need help with, let us know in the form on this page! Problems or projects of any size are invited (e.g. help to set up website events in Google Analytics, fix a weird NationBuilder bug, review a digital strategy, analyse digital fundraising statistics), but sessions will run for a maximum of 2 hours.</p>
    <p>Coaching is open to all progressive organisations, not just network members. </p>
